Introducing **Chore Dojo**- the chore-managing app that makes it easy for parents and children!

### Project Description 
This app, developed in Android Studio, is aimed at parents, incentivising their children to do chores or various house tasks. Parents/Admin can assign chores/tasks that, once completed, will give that child “points” that they could potentially redeem later. Admin can set rewards in a reward shop to further incentivise completion of tasks. 

### Project Features
- Parent Profile with parental controls  
- Customizable household to create and remove children  
- Marketplace to assign rewards with the Chore Dojo point system  

### Project Methodology
We had 5 members on our team, including a Team Lead, who presented our product, and a Project Manager, who oversaw the development process. Team members were assigned to different tasks, which were reviewed by our Team Project Manager before pushing. We used the Agile methodology to develop in sprints and Jira for project management.  

Our process consisted of:
- Submitting a proposal for professor review
- Developing project architecture and wireframe views
- Working in sprints to ensure deadlines are hit
- Presenting our product to our professor
